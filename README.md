üßÆ Matrix Calculator (Tkinter GUI)

## Description

The Matrix Calculator is a Python-based desktop application built using the Tkinter library. It provides an intuitive graphical interface to perform essential matrix operations, making it an excellent tool for students, educators, and professionals working with linear algebra. This project aims to simplify matrix calculations that are often tedious and error-prone when done manually.

## Key Features

Add Matrices: Perform element-wise addition of two matrices of the same dimensions.

Multiply by Constant: Multiply every element of a matrix by a constant scalar.

Matrix Multiplication: Multiply two compatible matrices using standard matrix multiplication rules.

Transpose: Flip a matrix over its diagonal.

Determinant: Compute the determinant of a square matrix.

Inverse: Calculate the inverse of a square matrix, if it exists.

Dark Mode: Toggle between light and dark themes for a better visual experience.

History Tracking: Automatically logs every operation performed during the session.

Export Options: Save your history as a .txt or .csv file.

Clear History: Clear the operation history at any time.

Splash Screen: Displays a brief welcome screen upon launching the application.

## User Interface:

The GUI is designed to be simple and user-friendly. Users enter matrix dimensions and values through dialog boxes, and results are displayed in separate pop-up windows. The interface dynamically adapts its theme based on the user‚Äôs preference.

# Dependencies:

Python 3.x

Tkinter (Standard library)

matrix.py module containing the matrix logic

# Usage:

Run the gui.py file to launch the application. The splash screen appears first, followed by the main calculator interface. Use the provided buttons to select the desired matrix operation.

This project is ideal for anyone looking to integrate mathematical operations into a clean and interactive desktop application using Python.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.x (recommended version: 3.8 or higher)

Tkinter: Python‚Äôs built-in GUI library

Matrix.py: Custom matrix operations script used in the project

You can install Tkinter by running:

    pip install tk

üß™ How to Run the Application:

Step 1: Clone the Repository

    git clone https://github.com/shashanksaranr/CODE-REFACTORING-AND-PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZATION.git

    cd CODE-REFACTORING-AND-PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZATION

Step 2: Run the App

    python3 gui.py 

This will open a GUI window where you can input matrix data and perform calculations.
